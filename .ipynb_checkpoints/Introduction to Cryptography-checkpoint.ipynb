    "A simple device that is often useful in cryptography is known as hashing. The idea is that a message, which may be of any length, is reduced to a ‘message digest’, which is a string of bits with a ﬁxed length. We shall explain how this process can be used to authenticate a message, and to guarantee its integrity – with some provisos.\n",

    "A simple application of this construction is that when Alice wishes to send Bob a message $m$, she actually sends the pair $(m,h(m))$. This pair may or may not be encrypted by Alice and decrypted by Bob in the usual way; in either case Bob should obtain a pair $(x,y)$ with $x = m$ and $y = h(m)$. If Bob gets a pair $(x,y)$ such that $h(x) = y$, he knows that something is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since messages can have any length, we can assume that the size of $M$ is greater than $2n$. This means that $h$ cannot be an injective function: there will surely be two different messages $m$ and $m'$ such that $h(m)=h(m')$. The latter, is known as a **collision**.\n",

    "In the 1970s, it was born a radical new approach to cryptography, known as *public key cryptography*. The fundamental idea is that a typical user (Bob) has two keys, a *public key* and a *private key*. The public key is used by Alice and others to encrypt messages that they wish to send to Bob, and the private key is used by Bob to decrypt these messages. The security of the system depends on ensuring that Bob’s private key cannot be found easily, even though everyone knows his public key. \n",

There are now many other systems of public key cryptography, but RSA is still widely used, and it is worth studying because it illustrates the basic principles simply and elegantly.\n",

    "For any positive integer $n$, the number of integers $x$ in the range $1 \\leq x \\leq n$ such that $gcd(x, n) = 1$ is denoted by $\\phi(n)$. It follow from the result stated above that $\\phi(n)$ is also the number of ivertible elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lema**. If $n = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes, then $\\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the RSA system there are a number of users, including, as always, Alice and Bob. Each user, say Bob, has an encryption function and a decryption function, constructed according to the following rules.\n",

    "* Choose two primer numbers $p, q$ and calculate \n",

    "\n",
    "The system works in the following way. Starting with $p$ and $q$, Bob uses the rules given above to construct, in turn, the numbers $n, \\phi, e$ and $d$. He makes his *public key* $(n, e)$ available to everyone, but keeps his *private key* $d$ secret. When Alice wished to send Bob a message, she expresses it in the form of a sequence of integers $m$ mod $n$, calculates $c = E_{n, e}(m)$, and sends $c$. Bob then uses his private key to compute $D_{n, d}(c)$. (Note that $n$ is not private, but it is needed in the construction of $D_{n, d}$).\n",

This in turn requires knowledge of the primes $p$ and $q$. But Eve knows only $n$, not the factorization $n = p \\cdot q$. The latter, is know as the Integer Factorization Problem, a main problem problem in the field of Computational Number Theory. Altohugh there is a good algorithm for multiplying $p$ and $q$, no one has yet found a good algorithm for \"unmultiplying\", that is, for finding $p$ and $q$ when $n$ is given."

    "Suppose Alice wishes to send the message $m$ to Bob, who would like to have irrefutable evidence that the message really come from Alice. Clearly, she must include include in the message her \"real\" name, so that Bob will be aware ot the purported sender. But she can also add a *signature*, $y = s(m)$, in a form that confirm her identity. Her definition of $s(m)$ must remain private, otherwise anyone could forge her signature. In order to verify that a message $m$ accompanied by a signature $y$ i really signed by Alcie, Bob must be able to decide whether or not $s(m)=y$ without precisely how Alice constructed the function $s$. Note that this procedure is quite different from the tradicional use of hand-written signatures. In that case a signature is a fixed object, independent of the message, whereas here the relationship between the signature and the message is crucial.\n",
